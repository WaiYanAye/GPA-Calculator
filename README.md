# GPA-Calculator
A simple GPA calculator.
Insert the amount credit and the grade for each course. Press Y and insert more if you take more than one course. Else press N.
For example, if you are taking one course that worth 1credit, put 1 in credit and put your grade (A, B, C, D, or F), then execute the code.
Repeat the same thing if you are taking more than one course.
Then the program will calculate your GPA for that semester.
